@article{RumelhartEtAl86,
	abstract = {Describes back-propagation, which is a set of learning rules for
	neural networks. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of
	the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the
	difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired
	output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal hidden
	units, not part of the input or output, come to represent important
	features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are
	captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create
	useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from other learning
	procedures.},

@article{Fukushima88,
	abstract = {A neural network model for visual pattern recognition, called the ``neocognitron,'' was previously proposed by the author. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of the model in detail. In order to demonstrate the ability of the neocognitron, we also discuss a pattern-recognition system which works with the mechanism of the neocognitron. The system has been implemented on a minicomputer and has been trained to recognize handwritten numerals. The neocognitron is a hierarchical network consisting of many layers of cells, and has variable connections between the cells in adjoining layers. It can acquire the ability to recognize patterns by learning, and can be trained to recognize any set of patterns. After finishing the process of learning, pattern recognition is performed on the basis of similarity in shape between patterns, and is not affected by deformation, nor by changes in size, nor by shifts in the position of the input patterns. In the hierarchical network of the neocognitron, local features of the input pattern are extracted by the cells of a lower stage, and they are gradually integrated into more global features. Finally, each cell of the highest stage integrates all the information of the input pattern, and responds only to one specific pattern. Thus, the response of the cells of the highest stage shows the final result of the pattern-recognition of the network. During this process of extracting and integrating features, errors in the relative position of local features are gradually tolerated. The operation of tolerating positional error a little at a time at each stage, rather than all in one step, plays an important role in endowing the network with an ability to recognize even distorted patterns.},

@book{JamesEtAl13,
	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.  Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},
